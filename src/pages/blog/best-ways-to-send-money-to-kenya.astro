  <h2>Tips for Sending Money to Kenya</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Compare exchange rates</strong> - Small differences can add up, especially for large transfers. Use our <a href="/kes-ugx" class="text-emerald-400 hover:underline">KES to UGX converter</a> if you're also dealing with Ugandan Shillings.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch out for hidden fees</strong> - Some services advertise 'no fees' but make money through poor exchange rates</li>
    <li><strong>Consider transfer speed</strong> - If speed isn't critical, you might get better rates with slower transfer options</li>
    <li><strong>Check for first-time user promotions</strong> - Many services offer fee-free transfers for new customers</li>
    <li><strong>Verify recipient details</strong> - Double-check M-PESA numbers and bank account details</li>
    <li><strong>Check regional rates</strong> - If you're transferring within East Africa, compare <a href="/kes-ugx" class="text-emerald-400 hover:underline">KES to UGX rates</a> for the best deal on cross-border transfers</li>
  </ol>
