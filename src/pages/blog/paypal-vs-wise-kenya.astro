  <h2>Key Differences</h2>
  
  <h3>1. Exchange Rates</h3>
  <p><strong>Wise</strong> uses the real mid-market exchange rate with a small markup (typically 0.5%). <strong>PayPal</strong> adds about 4% to the exchange rate, which is significantly higher.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Transfer Speed</h3>
  <p><strong>Wise</strong> transfers typically complete in 1-2 business days. <strong>PayPal</strong> transfers usually take 3-5 business days to reach a Kenyan bank account.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Recipient Options</h3>
  <p><strong>Wise</strong> allows transfers to Kenyan bank accounts and M-PESA. <strong>PayPal</strong> only supports bank transfers in Kenya, not M-PESA.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Withdrawal Options</h3>
  <p>With <strong>Wise</strong>, recipients can withdraw to their bank account or M-PESA. With <strong>PayPal</strong>, funds must be withdrawn to a bank account, which may incur additional bank fees.</p>
  
  <h2>When to Use PayPal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ The recipient already has a PayPal account and prefers it</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You're paying for goods or services (PayPal offers buyer protection)</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You're sending small amounts occasionally</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>When to Use Wise</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You want the best exchange rates and lowest fees</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You need to send money to M-PESA</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You make regular international transfers</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ You're sending larger amounts (savings increase with amount)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to Withdraw Money from PayPal to Kenya</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Link your Kenyan bank account to your PayPal account</li>
    <li>Go to 'Wallet' and click 'Transfer Money'</li>
    <li>Select 'Transfer to your bank account'</li>
    <li>Enter the amount and confirm the transfer</li>
    <li>Wait 3-5 business days for the funds to arrive</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="bg-amber-900 bg-opacity-20 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-4 my-6">
    <p class="font-bold text-amber-300 mb-2">Important:</p>
    <p>PayPal charges a 2.5% currency conversion fee when withdrawing to a Kenyan bank account, on top of their exchange rate markup.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>How to Use Wise to Send Money to Kenya</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a Wise account and verify your identity</li>
    <li>Choose 'Send money' and enter the amount</li>
    <li>Select 'Kenya' as the destination</li>
    <li>Choose whether to send to bank account or M-PESA</li>
    <li>Enter recipient details and send the money</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>For most people sending money to Kenya, <strong>Wise is the clear winner</strong> due to its significantly lower fees and better exchange rates. The savings can be substantial, especially for larger amounts.</p>
  
  <p>However, PayPal might be more convenient if the recipient already uses PayPal or if you need the buyer protection for purchases.</p>
